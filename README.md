mean
\mu = n * pμ=n∗p

In other words, a fair coin has a probability of a positive outcome (heads) p = 0.5. If you flip a coin 20 times, the mean would be 20 * 0.5 = 10; you'd expect to get 10 heads.

variance
\sigma^2 = n * p * (1 - p)σ 
2
 =n∗p∗(1−p)

Continuing with the coin example, n would be the number of coin tosses and p would be the probability of getting heads.

standard deviation
\sigma = \sqrt{n * p * (1 - p)}σ= 
n∗p∗(1−p)
​	 

or in other words, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

probability density function
f(k, n, p) = \frac{n\footnotesize{!}}{k!(n - k)!}p^k(1-p)^{(n-k)}f(k,n,p)= 
k!(n−k)!
